TO DOs
- auto adjust when browser is shortened
- appointment request CRUD
- appointments CRUD
- Route Model Binding in which a user can view other profiles not through HandleInertiaRequests (very important)
- UI Improvements (FINAL) - :value instead of :place holder on bio form (might need a non SFC vue import on this)
Done
- Validation error message for wrong input in login forms
- Use Separate multiple guard for User and Professionals (This was very fucking time consuming and hard for me)
- Log out feature for User and Professionals 
- Successful Flash Messages
- Working Register with Auth
- Register Professional Side ((Just use separate Register page for User and Professional to avoid confusion, or a dropdown select,
 makes sense to separate them after all)
- Frontend part of User Profile
- Backend part of User Profile (Editing)
- add a feature in register where you can select to register as a user or a professional
- professional CRUD
- User Delete
- profile for Professionals
- modal on delete
- feature in which a professional gets to add his list of services too (professional->services CRUD)
- bio edit presented the same way in Northspyre wherein u just click its texts and u can edit em, can also add a close button on the right side of bio
- user profile CRUD (just an imitation of professional profile)



CHAT GPT RESPONSE FOR SCROLLABLE MODAL HERE 


To make the modal scrollable, you need to set a maximum height for the modal container and allow it to overflow-y when the content exceeds that height. You're already using the max-h-full class to set the maximum height to the full viewport height. To make it scrollable, you can add the overflow-y-auto class to the modal container. Here's how you can modify your existing code:

html
Copy code
<div id="popup-modal" tabindex="-1" class="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 hidden p-4 overflow-x-hidden overflow-y-auto md:inset-0 h-[calc(100%-1rem)] max-h-full">
    <div class="relative w-full max-w-md max-h-full overflow-y-auto"> <!-- Add overflow-y-auto here -->
        <div class="relative bg-white rounded-lg shadow dark:bg-gray-700">
            <!-- Rest of your modal content -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
By adding the overflow-y-auto class to the inner container of your modal, the content will become scrollable when it exceeds the maximum height of the container.

Additionally, make sure that the content inside the modal doesn't have any fixed heights that could prevent scrolling, as this could interfere with the scroll behavior. The content within your modal should adapt to the available space and allow scrolling when necessary.
