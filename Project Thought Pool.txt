Currently Doing
- Register with login (Just use separate features for User and Professional, or a dropdown select,
 makes sense to separate them after all)

To Dos

- Working Register with Auth
- profile for Professionals
- profile for Users (maybe smaller details on this one)
- you might want to add a feature in which a professional gets to add his list of services too
- add a feature in register where you can select to register as a user or a professional

Done
- Validation error message for wrong input in login forms
- Use Separate multiple guard for User and Professionals (This was very fucking time consuming and hard for me)
- Log out feature for User and Professionals
