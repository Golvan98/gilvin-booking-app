CURRENTLY DOING : 

- UI for User/Professional profile
- Third column for profile grid should be info of how many appointments she has (just add a template on this fuck it you're doing too much)
- profile's too wide, narrow it down after all this maybe

IMPORTANT!: when you're done with viewUSER, remove settings from the admin part of User/Prof, put it onto the home or something

TO DOs
- Route Model Binding in which a user can view other profiles not through HandleInertiaRequests (very important)
- send rquest for application (user to prof function only)
- List of professionals UI
- filtering for list of professionals
- messaging 
- soft delete(optional)
- Deployment and UI improvements to run side by side

UI Improvements (FINAL). There really is a problem with ur UI when zoomed in or zoomed out, it's a whole project on top of another...
- auto adjust when browser is shortened (final)
- persist when clicking next page done, now u need to persist the modal when u accept/reject requests (hard one, this is left for the optimizing section)
- confirm button needs to be redone, required input error message doesnt work while closing modal
- check if it's possible to approve request and refresh paginated modal page at the same time
- placeholder for form to be :value request data
- for that value placeholder thingy, try that if edit modal is being executed

DONE
- Validation error message for wrong input in login forms
- Use Separate multiple guard for User and Professionals (This was very fucking time consuming and hard for me)
- Log out feature for User and Professionals 
- Successful Flash Messages
- Working Register with Auth
- Register Professional Side ((Just use separate Register page for User and Professional to avoid confusion, or a dropdown select,
 makes sense to separate them after all)
- Frontend part of User Profile
- Backend part of User Profile (Editing)
- add a feature in register where you can select to register as a user or a professional
- professional CRUD
- User Delete
- profile for Professionals
- modal on delete
- feature in which a professional gets to add his list of services too (professional->services CRUD)
- bio edit presented the same way in Northspyre wherein u just click its texts and u can edit em, can also add a close button on the right side of bio
- user profile CRUD (just an imitation of professional profile)
- data pagination for vuejs
- added Delete method for appointment requests (CRUD For requests now complete)
- appointment requests CRUD
- cleanup ur modals (group em)
- appointments on professional side
- converts request to appointment mutator when approved
