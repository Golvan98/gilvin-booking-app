Currently Doing
- Frontend part of User Profile

To Dos

- profile for Professionals
- profile for Users (maybe smaller details on this one)
- you might want to add a feature in which a professional gets to add his list of services too
- add a feature in register where you can select to register as a user or a professional
- auto adjust when browser is shortened

Done
- Validation error message for wrong input in login forms
- Use Separate multiple guard for User and Professionals (This was very fucking time consuming and hard for me)
- Log out feature for User and Professionals 
- Successful Flash Messages
- Working Register with Auth
- Register Professional Side ((Just use separate Register page for User and Professional to avoid confusion, or a dropdown select,
 makes sense to separate them after all)
