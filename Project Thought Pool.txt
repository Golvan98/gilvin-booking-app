Currently Doing

IDEA: <button @click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle</button>

<h1 v-if="awesome">Vue is awesome!</h1>
<h1 v-else>Oh no ðŸ˜¢</h1>

editable bio form will be wrapped under v-if, v-else is the standard uneditable bio

TO DOs

- appointments CRUD
- Route Model Binding in which a user can view other profiles not through HandleInertiaRequests (very important)
- UI Improvements (FINAL)
Done
- Validation error message for wrong input in login forms
- Use Separate multiple guard for User and Professionals (This was very fucking time consuming and hard for me)
- Log out feature for User and Professionals 
- Successful Flash Messages
- Working Register with Auth

 makes sense to separate them after all)
- Frontend part of User Profile
- Backend part of User Profile (Editing)
- add a feature in register where you can select to register as a user or a professional
- professional CRUD
- User Delete
- profile for Professionals
- modal on delete
- feature in which a professional gets to add his list of services too (professional->services CRUD)
- bio edit presented the same way in Northspyre wherein u just click its texts and u can edit em, can also add a close button on the right side of bio
