CURRENTLY DOING : 
Current Phase: UI Improvements, to launch deployment first month of 2024.

IMPORTANT NOTE!: regarding your UI ZOOM issues, it may be that it has something to do with meta viewport not working. it may be the only thing messing up ur divs when zoomed, u have done what is needed for 
screen appropriation, not zoom. You're good. The meta, not. Atleast you've done what's important.

NOTE: Flex's class w- and h- might rely on its parent grid size, to test more of this (keep everything in proportion, that way it'll always depend on the screen size, not absolute values like m-4, ml-24, etc.)
NOTE: to apply sm, md and lg, there must be specifications for each size
NOTE: - modal issue reference for a fix that might work https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite/issues/160 (also, using other plugins instead of vite might work for this)


============== PROJECT STATUS ================
PROJECT IS ON HOLD FOR NOW, until I resolve this modal and zoom issue, I might just restart the stack after building a simple UI-oriented project app
There's one problem on top of another, I must just deploy this, start another project focusing on UI to learn the solutions to the mistakes I've done in this project



============ Current UI Task =================
- flash messages and modals not appearing unless page is refreshed (THIS IS HUGE, FIX THIS BUG)
NOTE: This link might be suitable to replace ur current modals https://flowbite-vue.com/components/modal
and this too https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/vuejs-vue-modal-component


UI Improvements (FINAL). There really is a problem with ur UI when zoomed in or zoomed in/out... (ACTUALLY NOPE, it's the zoom scaling meta not working, there must be a way to fix this, but for some reason
the environment you setup is buggy as shit, even the modals are not working properly. sigh.)
- confirm button needs to be redone, required input error message doesnt work while closing modal
- placeholder for form to be :value request data - for that value placeholder thingy, try that if edit modal is being executed OR u can call its value from that @click="Selected.value" 
- flash messages and modals not appearing unless page is refreshed (THIS IS HUGE, FIX THIS BUG)


POSSIBLY IMPOSSIBLE:
- check if it's possible to approve request and refresh paginated modal page at the same time
- when clicking law/engineering/medical, visit this professionals page with preloaded filters
- persist the modal when u accept/reject requests (hard one, this is left for the optimizing section)

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
- DB restrict appointments end schedule to be before start schedule

Optional Features (Nah, not doing this)
- messaging (optional)
- soft delete users(optional)



DONE
- Validation error message for wrong input in login forms
- Use Separate multiple guard for User and Professionals (This was very fucking time consuming and hard for me)
- Log out feature for User and Professionals 
- Successful Flash Messages
- Working Register with Auth
- Register Professional Side ((Just use separate Register page for User and Professional to avoid confusion, or a dropdown select,
 makes sense to separate them after all)
- Frontend part of User Profile
- Backend part of User Profile (Editing)
- add a feature in register where you can select to register as a user or a professional
- professional CRUD
- User Delete
- profile for Professionals
- modal on delete
- feature in which a professional gets to add his list of services too (professional->services CRUD)
- bio edit presented the same way in Northspyre wherein u just click its texts and u can edit em, can also add a close button on the right side of bio
- user profile CRUD (just an imitation of professional profile)
- data pagination for vuejs
- added Delete method for appointment requests (CRUD For requests now complete)
- appointment requests CRUD
- cleanup ur modals (group em)
- appointments on professional side
- converts request to appointment mutator when approved
- number to reflect how many request/appointments there currently are for the current user
- upload photo profile professional side
- UI for User/Professional profile 
- Route Model Binding in which a user can view other profiles not through HandleInertiaRequests (very important)
- when you're done with viewUSER, remove settings from the admin part of User/Prof, put it onto the home or something
- List of professionals UI, image reference for it sent
- send request for application (user to prof function only, and a a modal would be nice)
- lapsed status db trigger if appointment has passed by
- notifications (When watching Piotr Udemy's mark as read feature, there might be some code that u needed there
where the page refreshes after you click "mark as read" (nope, just a redirect and v-if condition that made it disappear)
- mark as read Notifications for Users
- Notification for when request is rejected and sent 
- Notification for the Professional side? Like when a user sends a req, the professional is notified 
- in the Professional's notification, add an href link to user 
- mark as read Notifications for Professionals(route already created for this, it needs another single action controller like the one used for User
- notification when appointment is cancelled 
- add a view appointment option for each appointment notification
- Add an href link to the newly made appointment on the Request Accepted notification (v-for appoinntment 
- Add an href link to the newly made appointment on the Request Rejected notification
- pagination for notifications (should be easy)
- modal to view request from notifications page
- filtering for list of professionals


UI Tasks Done
- navbar to auto adjust when shrinked
- format date time to readable (this can be done frontend or backend)
professional list adjusting according to screen size, zoom's meta viewport function is not working for some reason.
- working href links, and trimmed homepage content
- professional list adjusting according to screen size, zoom's meta viewport function is not working for some reason.
