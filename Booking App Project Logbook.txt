- Set up project. Name in folder is gilvin-booking-app
- Added Vue and Vite to project stack (added import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue') in vite.config.js
- set up inertia, follow documentation next time. The guide skipped a step (server side).
u run composer require inertiajs/inertia-laravel first and then npm install @inertiajs/vue3
- uploaded project to github. using main section for some reason. idk how all this github shit works but it's there so... ok.

- resorted to sourcing images online, for now. 
- figured out sourcing images, it's just <img class="object-fill w-3/4 h-3/4 " src="/storage/rayz.png">. Forget those asset and (url) stuff I guess
- background image loaded for homepage content. Used online sourcing for now since above method is kinda unstable
- body content with bg image and shadows added

- found the default storage directory for ur images, it's app/public/storage, NOT app/storage, or app/public.

- finalized footer content, now working on the header, home/front page is almost done
