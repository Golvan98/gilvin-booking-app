- Set up project. Name in folder is gilvin-booking-app
- Added Vue and Vite to project stack (added import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue') in vite.config.js

u run composer require inertiajs/inertia-laravel first and then npm install @inertiajs/vue3
- uploaded project to github. using main section for some reason. idk how all this github shit works but it's there so... ok.

June 28
- tried to load pics from localfile using the old way, didnt work

June 29
- resorted to sourcing images online, for now. 
- figured out sourcing images, it's just <img class="object-fill w-3/4 h-3/4 " src="/storage/rayz.png">. Forget those asset and (url) stuff I guess
- background image loaded for homepage content. Used online sourcing for now since above method is kinda unstable
- body content with bg image and shadows added

June 30
- lower body UI update
- found the default storage directory for ur images, it's app/public/storage, NOT app/storage, or app/public.
- 2/3 of Footer done

July 04:
- added raw content for the rightside of the footer
- finalized footer content, now working on the header, home/front page is almost done
- completed landing page. now to work on database while I figure out what pages to add next.
- added new attribute to appointment which is appointment_status, values in mind are pending, on going, r√üejected, and done.
- executed "docker compose up" for the project. Tried to mess with its settings since it's using too much ram, will mess with it further tomorrow

July 05
- docker compose setting now primed for less ram usage.
- properly placed a db connection to docker. DB is connection is set
- created model and performed first db migration

- IMPORTANT NOTE!!! showing ext in Windows 10 Settings for the name files is important, it wasted 2days worth of debugging
